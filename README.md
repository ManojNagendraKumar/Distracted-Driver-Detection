Overview
Distracted Driver Detection is a deep learning-based project that identifies driver behaviors using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset of 22,000+ images to accurately detect distractions such as texting, eating, or looking away while driving.

Key Features
Achieves 99.5% accuracy, improving detection precision by 12%.
Optimized YOLOv8 architecture, reducing inference time to 15ms per image.
Enhances model robustness with Mosaic augmentation, CLAHE, and affine transformations for reliable performance in varying conditions.
Supports real-time driver monitoring and alert systems for improved road safety.

Technologies Used
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, YOLOv8
